I think here I will give an overview of the paper and what's in the folders. I'll point readers towards the README files in "calibration_scripts" and "reconstruction_scripts" for information on how to set up environments and run the code.

Make sure to discuss:
1. Installing. last stpe will probably be "conda develop ."
2. Neptune (right now can't conda install, need to do pip). and can give project id or whatever
3. Editing path to data in the config file 
4. which folders to go into to run specific scripts
