This folder contains a MATLAB folder for visualizing reconstructed FiLM-Scope data as a 3D mesh. This script requires ``matlab_video_files`` to be downloaded from our data repository: https://doi.org/10.7924/r4hd8386m. This folder contains the results of 3D reconstruction for two videos acquired on the FiLM-Scope. The location of this folder must be specified in the script. 

"mesh_display.m" shows how to display any reconstructed height map as a 3D mesh. 

Both scripts were tested using MATLAB R2024a.
