This folder contains a MATLAB folder for visualizing reconstructed FiLM-Scope data as a 3D mesh. This script requires ``matlab_video_files`` to be downloaded from the google drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q-tyXVybuK36g5OZaqQBDijxQNmk1Nps?usp=sharing). This folder contains the results of 3D reconstruction for two videos acquired on the FiLM-Scope. The location of this folder must be specified in the script. 


This script was tested using MATLAB R2024a.
